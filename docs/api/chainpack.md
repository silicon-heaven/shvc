# Chainpack tools

The basic utilities for working with Chainpack data. This provides definitions
and simple operations you need to unpack and pack data in Chainpack format. This
is not a most user friendly way to work with Chainpack. It is suggester rather
to use [packer and unpacker](./cp.md) instead.
